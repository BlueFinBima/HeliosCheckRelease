# HeliosCheckRelease
Files to allow determination of the currency of Helios.

## Making a New Release Live
It is important to realise that the file checked by Helios is the 
asset "```HeliosCurrentVersionV2.xml```" in the release tagged "```CheckRelease```".
The source file of the same name is pretty much irrelevant so don't go 
commiting a new version of this file because it will not have the desire
effect.  You need to edit the release and change the asset.
